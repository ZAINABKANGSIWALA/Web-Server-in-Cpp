 C++ Socket-Based Web Server 
Last year, I developed a custom socket-based web server in C++, engineered to handle HTTP communication over TCP/IP. This server was capable of receiving and processing both GET and POST requests directly from web browsers and responding with appropriate HTTP responses.

Although I no longer have access to the source code, you can watch a demo of the project in action below:

🌟 Core Features:
🔌 Socket Layer: Listens for incoming network connections and manages a queue of pending requests.

🤝 Connection Handling: Accepts one connection at a time and processes it efficiently.

🌐 HTTP Protocol Support: Parses HTTP GET and POST requests and generates valid HTTP responses.

🚦 Routing System: Custom application-level container to manage routing and handler functions.

🧠 Custom Endpoints: Support for defining user-specific route functions and logic.

🔁 Request Forwarding: Built-in logic to forward HTTP requests as needed.

📁 Static File Serving: Delivers HTML, CSS, JS, and image files from local storage.

🧩 Custom Template Engine: Dynamically renders content using an in-house built template engine (a highlight feature).

📚 Key Learning Outcomes:
This project served as a deep dive into:

Low-level socket programming

HTTP protocol internals

Systems-level C++ development

Multithreaded server design

Backend architecture and web fundamentals
